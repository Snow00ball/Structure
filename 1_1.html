<p style="margin-top:30px;">I might lose my mind<br>
Waking when the sun's down<br>
Riding all these highs<br>
Waiting for the comedown<br>
Walk these streets with me<br>
<strong>Just glad that I can <u>breathe,</u> yeah</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to realize<br>
It's alright to not be fine on your own</p>

<p>Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee<br>
These last few weeks have been exhausting<br>
I'm lost in my imagination<br>
And there's one thing that I need from you<br>
Can you come through, through?<br>
Through, yeah<br>
And there's one thing that I need from you<br>
Can you come through?</p>

<p>Ain't got much to do<br>
Too old for my hometown<br>
Went to bed at noon<br>
Couldn't put my phone down<br>
Scrolling patiently<br>
It's all the same to me<br>
Just faces on a screen, yeah</p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to realize</strong><br>
It's alright to not be fine on your own</p>

<p>Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee<br>
These last few weeks have been exhausting<br>
I'm lost in my <u>imagination</u><br>
<strong>Can you <u>come</u> through, through?</strong><br>
Through, yeah<br>
And there's one thing that I need from you</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:50px;">Can you come<br>
Through, through<br>
Through, yeah<br>
And there's one thing that I need from you<br>
Can you come through?</p>
